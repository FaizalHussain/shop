Those with high exposure can last up to approximately 10 months. Rubber parts are anti-rust and are long lasting as compared to plastic parts.    We manufacture our rubber products according to a certain criteria. Some products need to be designed to especially stand heat and resist oil. We make sure that the materials used will provide the features required.
